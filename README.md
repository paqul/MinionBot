# Discord RPG Dice Bot aka **MinionBot**

This Discord bot is designed to facilitate dice rolling for various tabletop role-playing games (RPGs). It supports a wide range of dice types and special rolling mechanics for games like Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, and Mork Borg.
Currently it returns messages only in Polish language.

## Features

- Standard dice rolling (d2, d3, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d16, d20, d24, d30, d66, d100, d1000)
- Rolls with modifiers (e.g., 1d20+5)
- Advantage/Disadvantage rolls for D&D 5e
- Bonus/Penalty dice for Call of Cthulhu
- Special d66 roll for Mork Borg
- D&D stat block generation
- Auto-test functionality

## How to Deploy

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install discord.py
3. Create a `params.py` file in the root directory and add your Discord bot token:
```python
token = "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
```
4. Run the bot: 
python main.py

## Structure Overview

- `bot_config.py`: Sets up the Discord bot and handles message events.
- `responses.py`: Processes user messages and determines appropriate responses by passing to `rolls.py`.
- `rolls.py`: Contains the logic for various dice rolling functions and formatting response messages.
- `roles.py`: Handles role assignments for new members (customizable).

The bot also includes an auto-test feature that can be triggered with the command `@BotName autotest`. This runs through a series of predefined rolls to ensure all functionalities are working correctly.

## How to Use

Once the bot is running and added to your Discord server, you can use the following commands:

- Roll dice: XdY (e.g., 1d20, 3d6)
- Roll with modifier: XdY+Z (e.g., 1d20+5)
- Advantage roll (D&D 5e): XdYa (e.g., 1d20a, 1d20a+5)
- Disadvantage roll (D&D 5e): XdYd (e.g., 1d20d, 1d20d+5)
- Bonus die & double bonus die(Call of Cthulhu): XdYp (e.g., 1d100p, 1d100pp)
- Penalty die & double penalty die (Call of Cthulhu): XdYk (e.g., 1d100k, 1d100kk)
- Mork Borg special roll: Xd66 (e.g., 1d66)
- Generate D&D stat block: statystyki_dnd
- Get help: help

Replace X with the number of dice, Y with the type of die, and Z with the modifier value.
How It Works
The bot listens for messages in specified channels. When it receives a valid command, it processes the request and returns the result of the dice roll(s). The bot uses regular expressions to parse commands and determine which type of roll to perform.
